54. Write a Java program to check if a given array contains a subarray with 0 sum.

Example:
Input :
nums1= { 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
nums2 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
nums3 = { 1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6 }
Output:
Does the said array contain a subarray with 0 sum: true
Does the said array contain a subarray with 0 sum: false
Does the said array contain a subarray with 0 sum: true

58. Given two sorted arrays A and B of size p and q, write a Java program to merge elements of A with B by maintaining the sorted order i.e. fill A with first p smallest elements and fill B with remaining elements.

Example:
Input :
int[] A = { 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 }
int[] B = { 2, 4, 9 }
Output:
Sorted Arrays:
A: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
B: [8, 9, 10]
